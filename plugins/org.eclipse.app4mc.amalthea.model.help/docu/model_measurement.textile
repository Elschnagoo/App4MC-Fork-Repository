h2. Measurement Model


The measurement model provides the possibility to store runtime measurements. The main purpose is to exchange measured times, either as a series of single values or as derived statistical data.

**Warning**: This model has no connections to the configuration and should not be used for any kind of timing simulation inputs or automatic configuration tools. Its main purpose is to document a specific situation that has to be exchanged between development partners. Therefore the origin of the data should be clearly identifiable using additional info like "creator", "date" or "hardware" entered as custom attributes of __MeasurementModel__.

Changing the model should result in an invalidation of the measurement model. For use cases such as timing simulation the measurement model is of no importance and should be ignored.

Measurements refer to given elements of other model parts and can easily be exchanged (added, removed, updated).
