h2. Measurement Model


The measurement model provides the possibility to store runtime measurements. The main purpose is to exchange measured times, either as a series of single values or as derived statistical data.

Measurements refer to given elements of other model parts and can easily be exchanged (added, removed, updated).

Additional info like "creator", "date" or "hardware" should be entered as custom attributes of __MeasurementModel__.
