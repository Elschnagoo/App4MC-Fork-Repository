h2. AMALTHEA Model Definition


h3. Ecore

The AMALTHEA model is specified with the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Eclipse/Java developers can use the AMALTHEA Platform where the generated Java classes of the model are included. The underlying Xcore definition of the model is part of the model plugin.

The derived *Ecore files* can be found "here":../help-model/ecore-definitions.zip.

h3. XML Schema Definition (XSD)

For developers that are not using Java or Eclipse, the specification is also provided in the XSD format. The *XSD files* can be found "here":../help-model/xml-schema-definitions.zip.

The AMALTHEA model references an external model definitions:
- The Ecore model (http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore)

The XSD file for the Ecore model can be found on the "Eclipse EMF download page":http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/downloads/ 
Download the __Models__ package from __Latest Releases__. The download contains a folder "org.eclipse.emf.ecore_*". This folder contains the XSD schema for Ecore.

The Franca model has no longer a direct connection but still can be used to describe interfaces.

Franca is only available as Ecore file. To generate an XSD schema open the AMALTHEA Tool Platform and do the following steps:

Open the Plug-Ins View by selecting __Window -> Show View -> Other__ and select Plug-Ins View in the folder Plug-in Development:

!../pictures/xsd/show_plugins_view.png!

Select the plug-in __org.franca.core__ and import it as __Binary Project__:

!../pictures/xsd/import_franca-core.png!

Open the model folder in the imported project, do a right click on the "franca.genmodel" file and select "Export Model".

!../pictures/xsd/export_model.png!

Select the entry "XML Schema for XMI" in the first wizard page.

!../pictures/xsd/export_wizard1.png!

Navigate to the last wizard page, select "org.franca.core.franca" and click finish.

!../pictures/xsd/export_wizard2.png!

Now there the file "francaXMI.xsd" in the model folder.
