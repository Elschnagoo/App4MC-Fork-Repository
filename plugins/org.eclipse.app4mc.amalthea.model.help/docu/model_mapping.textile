h1. Mapping Model

The mapping model is intended to provide tools that use hardware and software models (e.g. code generators) information about the corresponding mappings and allocations. This information contains associations between
* schedulers and executable software: A scheduler manages and distributes executable software like runnables or tasks on its managed cores,
* schedulers and cores: A scheduler can manage one or more cores and deploy computations on these
* data and memories: Data (such as functions, variables, heap etc) is mapped on static and volatile memories.

h2. Overview

The Meta Model specifying the Mapping Model is shown below.

h3. MappingModel

The __MappingModel__ serves as a container for each of the mapping rules, i.e. __Allocations__ (executable software and cores which are allocated to schedulers) and __Mappings__ (labels and software which is mapped to memories).

h2. Mapping

The __Mapping__ is an abstract class, describing the mapping of parts of the software model to __Memory__. The target memory is specified by a reference to an explicit __Memory__ within an existing hardware model. The position in memory can also be defined as address here. If the address is a absolute memory address, a offset address from the memories first address, or if the address information is not expected at all is defined by the __Memory Address Mapping Type__ enumeration in the root element of the __Mapping Model__. The  Additional attributes, e.g. to supply further information for a code generator, may be described by the containment attributeList.

h3. SectionMapping

The __SectionMapping__ is a specialization of the __Mapping__. It is used to associate __Sections__, specified within the software model, with a __Memory__.

h3. AbstractElementMapping

The __AbstractElementMapping__ is a specialization of the __Mapping__. It is used to associate specializations of the __AbstractElementMemoryInformation__ (i.e. __Label__, __Runnable__, __TaskPrototype__ and __Process__), specified within the software model, with a __Memory__. 

h2. Allocation

h3. CoreAllocation

The __CoreAllocation__ describes the allocation of cores to a __Scheduler__. This class consists of references to the respective __Scheduler__, which specified within an existing OS model, and a core, which is specified in a hardware model. Further attributes, which may be used to supply additional information, e.g. for a code generator, may be described by the containment attributeList.

h3. RunnableAllocation

The __RunnableAllocation__ is a specialization of the __ExecutableAllocation__. It is used to associate a __Runnable__, specified within an existing software model, with a __Scheduler__.
 
h3. ProcessAllocation

This is the abstract description of the mapping of a __Process__ (i.e. __Task__ and __ISR__) to a __Scheduler__ (i.e. __TaskScheduler__ and __InterruptController__).

h3. ISRAllocation

This is a specification of __ProcessAllocation__. The __ISRAllocation__ is used to associate  an __ISR__ with an __InterruptConroller__.

h3. TaskAllocation

This is a specification of __ProcessAllocation__. The __TaskAllocation__ is used to associate a __Task__ with a __TaskScheduler__.
