h1. Model Details

h2. Unique ID generation

AMALTHEA uses a named based schema to reference other elements inside of a model.
A custom implementation is used instead of the standard EMF mechanism, which uses an index based implementation.
The target element id is identified by the following schema:

bc. 
java.net.URLEncoder.encode(<name of element>, StandardCharsets.UTF_8.toString)) + "?type=" + <element>.eClass.name

Samples:

Referencing a Runnable element with name foo in a TaskRunnableCall looks like the following snippet:

bc. 
<calls xsi:type="am:TaskRunnableCall" runnable="foo?type=Runnable" />
