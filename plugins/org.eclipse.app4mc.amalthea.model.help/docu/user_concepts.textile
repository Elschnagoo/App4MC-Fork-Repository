h4. Grouping of elements (Tags, Tag groups)

It is possible to use "Tags":./model_common.html#common-tags for grouping elements of the model.


h4. Custom Properties

The AMALTHEA model provides "Custom Properties":./model_basics.html#basics-custom-props to enhance the model in a generic way. These can be used for different kind of purpose:

* Store attributes, which are relevant for your model, but not yet available at the elements
* Processing information of algorithms can be stored in that way, e.g. to mark an element as already processed
