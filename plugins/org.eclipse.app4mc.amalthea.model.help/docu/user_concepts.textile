h1. General Concepts

h2. Grouping of elements (Tags, Tag groups)

It is possible to use "Tags":./model_common.html#Tags for grouping elements of the model. Currently two AMALTHEA models are supporting Tags:

# Components
# Software (SW)

Both models are storing the relevant Tags in a local list, available in the @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.components.ComponentsModel@ and @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.sw.SWModel@ class. 
The reason for doing this is that Tags used in the components have another type of technical background than Tags in the software model. It should not be the case that elements in the software model are referencing Tags from a components model and reverse.

h2. Custom Properties

The AMALTHEA model provides "Custom Properties":./model_common.html#CP to enhance the model in a generic way. These can be used for different kind of purpose:

* Store attributes, which are relevant for your model, but not yet available at the elements
* Processing information of algorithms can be stored in that way, e.g. to mark an element as already processed
