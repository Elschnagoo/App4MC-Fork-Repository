h1. General Concepts

h2. Grouping of elements (Tags, Tag groups)

It is possible to use "Tags":./model_common.html#Tags for grouping elements of the model. Currently the following AMALTHEA sub models are supporting Tags:

# Components
# Software (SW)
# Hardware (HW)

The corresponding model classes are storing the relevant Tags in a local list, available in: 
* @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.ComponentsModel@
* @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.SWModel@
* @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.HWModel@
The reason for doing this is that Tags used in the sub models mostly have a different technical background. It should  be avoided that e.g. elements in the software model are referring to Tags from a components model.

h2. Custom Properties

The AMALTHEA model provides "Custom Properties":./model_common.html#CP to enhance the model in a generic way. These can be used for different kind of purpose:

* Store attributes, which are relevant for your model, but not yet available at the elements
* Processing information of algorithms can be stored in that way, e.g. to mark an element as already processed
