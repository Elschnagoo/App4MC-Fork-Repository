h4. Grouping of elements (Tags, Tag groups)

It is possible to use "Tags":./model_common.html#common-tags for grouping elements of the model. Currently the following AMALTHEA objects are supporting Tags:

* abstract class AbstractMemoryElement
* abstract class Activation
* class OsEvent

* abstract class Event

* abstract class Stimulus

* abstract class HardwareTypeDescription
* abstract class ComplexNode
* class Quartz

* class System
* class Component
* class ComponentInstance
* class Connector
* abstract class Port



h4. Custom Properties

The AMALTHEA model provides "Custom Properties":./model_common.html#common-custom-props to enhance the model in a generic way. These can be used for different kind of purpose:

* Store attributes, which are relevant for your model, but not yet available at the elements
* Processing information of algorithms can be stored in that way, e.g. to mark an element as already processed
