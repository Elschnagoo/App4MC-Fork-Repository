h2. Version ITEA 1.1.1 to App4MC 0.7.0

Below are the changes in the metamodel from ITEA 1.1.1 version to APP4MC 0.7.0

* Instead of multiple namespaces (e.g: sw,hw,constraints,components etc.,) a single namespace "am" is introduced
** *Impact on 0.7.0 model file due to this change:* 
*** xmlns:am="http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.0 is included in the xmi file, instead of other namespaces (e.g: xmlns:hw, xmlns:sw etc.,)
*** xsi:type attributes will consists of namespace prefix as "am" in the value. Example: <br/> @<ports xsi:type="am:ComplexPort" name="Mem_1_port" bitWidth="16" direction="R" writeCycles="10" readCycles="10"/>@
*** Root tag will have "am" as the prefix. Example: <br/> @<am:HWModel xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:am="http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.0"/>@
* Reference pattern is changed. <br/> As there is single model namespace in 0.7.0, namespace prefix is removed before the class name (eg: "ABSMode?type=Label").
** old: @<Element Name>?type=<NameSpace prefix>.<ElementClassName>@
** new: @<Element Name>?type=<ElementClassName>@
* Root tag of the model, changed from *AMALTHEA* to *Amalthea* 
* *IPort* interface is changed to abstract class *Port*
* FInterface reference (i.e. Franca Interface) is removed from class FInterfacePort 
**  *Impact on 0.7.0 model file due to this change:* 
*** If AMALTHEA models from previous versions have the reference to Franca Interface ports, as a part of migration this reference is removed. (_In this case, reference to the Franca Interface element is stored as a CustomProperty of type String inside FInterfacePort element_)
* InterfaceKind ENUM literal values are changed from PROVIDES, REQUIRES to provides, requires
* Following class names are changed <br/><br/>  

table(#classic){margin-left:40px}. 
|**Class name from 1.1.1** | **Changed Class name in 0.7.0** |
| OSEvent | OsEvent |
| MemType | MemoryType |
| System | HwSystem |
| Component | HwComponent |
| Port | HwPort |
| AbstractionType | AbstractionTypeDescription |
| MemoryType | MemoryTypeEnum |
| OSInstructions | OsInstructions |
| Periodic | PeriodicActivation |

* Below references are removed inside ComplexNode and HardwareTypeDescription (_both these class's are part of Hardware Model_)
** AbstractType[] attribute , AbstractType[] features
*** *Impact on 0.7.0 model file due to this change:* Content inside the attribute and features is stored as a CustomProperty elements inside the corresponding elements. 
**** Content of "AbstractType[] attribute" is stored in the CustomProperty, with key as "attribute#<attribute name>" and value as <attribute value>
**** Content of "AbstractType[] features" is stored in the CustomProperty, with key as "feature#<feature name>" and value as <feature value>
*** Below figure shows the changes between 1.1.1 model (_containing attributes & features_) and the corresponding 0.7.0 model (_created using model migration utility_)!(#gray_scale)../pictures/hwmodel_attributes_features.png! 
* ProcessAllocation class removed from MappingModel, instead ISRAllocation (_maps ISR and InterruptController_)  and TaskAllocation (_maps Task and Scheduler_) 
** *Impact on 0.7.0 model file due to this change:* 
*** processAllocation tag is removed from mappingModel, and instead of this taskAllocation and isrAllocation tags will be generated accordingly. <br/> For details refer to the image <br/> !(#gray_scale)../pictures/mappingmodel_processallocations.png!
* Below are the changes in the reference names :

table(#classic){margin-left:40px}.

h2. Version App4MC 0.7.0 to App4MC 0.7.1

Below are the changes in the metamodel from App4MC 0.7.0 to App4MC 0.7.1

*Change in the namespace:* 

table(#classic){margin-left:40px}. 
| *_AMALTHEA Namespace (version App4MC 0.7.0)_* | *_AMALTHEA Namespace  (version App4MC 0.7.1)_* |
|http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.0 |http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.1 |

*Root Tag in AMALTHEA model amxmi file*: It is recommended to have "Amalthea" as a root tag in amxmi file.

Based on the above statement, if the AMALTHEA model file is having sub-model tag as root element (e.g: SWModel or HWModel etc.,), as a part of model migration -> root element is changed as "Amalthea" tag and the content of sub-model is copied inside it. 

 Input model (containing SWModel as the root tag):
 
bc. 
 "<am:SWModel xmi:version="2.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI" xmlns:am="http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.0">
  <labels/>
</am:SWModel>"


 Output model (after model migration):
 
bc.  <am:Amalthea xmlns:am="http://app4mc.eclipse.org/amalthea/0.7.0" xmlns:xmi="http://www.omg.org/XMI">
  <swModel>
    <labels />
  </swModel>
</am:Amalthea>
