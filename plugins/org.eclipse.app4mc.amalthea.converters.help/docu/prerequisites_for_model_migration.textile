h3. Pre-requisites for AMALTHEA model migration

h4(#migration-vm-args). VM arguments

Default max heap memory (Xmx) used by the APP4MC distribution is 2 GB. In case of migrating huge models, it is recommended to increase this memory to 4 GB before invocation of "AMALTHEA Model Migration" feature

Follow the below steps to increase the heap memory setting of APP4MC :

* Open *app4mc.ini* file (_present in the location where APP4MC is installed_) and change the parameter -Xmx from 2g to 4g. (_*Note*: In case if APP4MC plugins are integrated inside custom eclipse application, then corresponding &lt;application_name&gt;.ini file -Xmx parameter should be updated as specified below_)
