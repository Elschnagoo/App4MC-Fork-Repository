h3. How to invoke AMALTHEA model migration


h4. Simple migration

An attempt to open an older model file in the model editor will show the following dialog.

!../pictures/ui/file_open_dialog.png!

The default button will simply migrate the selected file ...
* provided it doesn't have any references (only allowing single file migration)
* the original file is renamed (the version string is added, e.g. "model_0.9.2.amxmi")
* a log file with the current date is created (e.g. "ModelMigration__2019-07-30_15_43_44.log")


h4. Migration dialog

AMALTHEA model migration utility is developed as a eclipse plugin and it is part of APP4MC distribution (_from release 0.7.0_)

Model migration utility can be invoked by selecting the required models to be migrated in the UI and specifying the target AMALTHEA version to which models should be migrated


* **Step 1:** Selection of AMALTHEA models

* *Step 2:* Opening AMALTHEA Model Migration dialog and configuring migration inputs

On click of AMALTHEA Model Migration action, selected files are parsed and the following information is retrieved:

# AMALTHEA model version to which model is belonging to
# Referred AMALTHEA models inside the selected model (_i.e. case of cross document references_) 
** AMALTHEA model version to which these models are belonging to

Once the above information is successfully retrieved, following Model Migration dialog is opened:

Model Migration dialog consists of following information:

# Selected AMALTHEA model files : These are the models which are explicitly selected by the user
# Model scope files : These are the model files which are referred in the models explicitly selected by the user <div>_Example:_ In the dialog shown above, mapping.amxmi is the file selected by the user, and it contains references to the model elements of : sw.amxmi, sw.amxmi-sw, default.amxmi-os. Due to this reason, all these referred models are selected implicitly for model migration <br/>*_Note:_* In case if the selected/referred models are having the different AMALTHEA model versions, migration can not be proceeded and the following error dialog is displayed <br/> !(gray_scale)../pictures/ui/different_model_versions.png! </div>
# Input model version : This is the AMALTHEA model version to which both selected & referred models are belonging to
# Output model version : This is the AMALTHEA model version to which both selected & referred models should be migrated to
# Output directory : This is the location where migrated AMALTHEA models should be generated.


* *Step 3:* Model migration

Once the required parameters are configured in the model migration dialog, click on "Migrate Models" button in the dialog to invoke migration.
