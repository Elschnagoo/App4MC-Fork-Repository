h1. Overview of Features and Plug-ins

h2. Features

There are two top-level features of the AMALTHEA Tool Platform, the AMALTHEA Tool Platform and the AMALTHEA Tool Platform SDK features. The non-SDK feature contains everything you need to run the AMALTHEA tools and models. If you like to develop new tools on top of the models or extend the models you may need the SDK. It contains beside the runtime all sources.

The top-level feature itself contains basic platform plug-ins and tools as well as several sub-features. These are
* AMALTHEA Models - The AMALTHEA EMF models.
* AMALTHEA Editors - Editors and validation for the models.
* AMALTHEA Workflow - Defining workflows on the model.
* AMALTHEA Variability - AMALTHEA Variability model and tools.
* AMALTHEA Multicore - Algorithms for multicore develepment like partitioning and mapping.
* AMALTHEA Export - Exports of the models.
* AMALTHEA Tracing - Record, analyze and transform runtime traces of the embedded system.
* AMALTHEA Documentation - Help and Examples of AMALTHEA projects that can be added to the workbench in runtime by the example wizard.

For all of these features there also exists an SDK containing the sources. If you install the AMALTHEA Tool Platform SDK, it contains all features as SDKs.
