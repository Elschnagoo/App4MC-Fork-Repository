h3. Usage of AMALTHEA Model Validation

The AMALTHEA model validation can be triggered by clicking on the "Validate" button of the Amalthea editor.

All elements of the model are included for validation. In the next window the list of profiles appears allowing the selection of specific validations.

If an error is found, it is shown in the Problems view of Eclipse. A simple double click on the error will lead you to the affected elements in the AMALTHEA model. The validation distinguishes between three error types: __errors__, __warnings__ and __info__.
