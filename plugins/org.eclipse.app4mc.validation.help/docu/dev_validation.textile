h2. Model Validation






h3. Sphinx check-based validations -- *@Deprecated !!*

AMALTHEA tried to use the Sphinx validation project to include custom model validations.
Due to massive problems this approach will be abandoned.


h3. New validation framework

The next version of APP4MC will contain a new implementation based on standard EMF validations.

The core plugins are already included in this release:

- org.eclipse.app4mc.validation.core := Includes the basic implementation to organize and execute validations.

- org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.validations := First subset of the AMALTHEA standard validations
