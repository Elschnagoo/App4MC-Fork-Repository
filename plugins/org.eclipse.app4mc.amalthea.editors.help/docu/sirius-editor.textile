h2. Sirius Viewer

Basic graphical viewers are realized using "Sirius":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/.

The following viewers are treated as a POC (Proof of concept) and are not final.
They can be extended and further developed to show additional parts of the model.

h3. Activate capabilities for project

The following steps will activate the Sirius feature and AMALTHEA viewpoints:

To use Sirius, projects needs to have the __Modeling Feature__ enabled. This can be done by right clicking on the project and select *Configure - Convert to Modeling Project*. Note that a new file __representations.aird__ is created at top level of the project. This file is containing the user created diagrams.

Activate the AMALTHEA viewpoint by right click on the project and select *Viewpoint Selection*.

**Note:** Using one of the available commands to open a view using a right click on an element automatically adds the Modeling Nature and selects the available AMALTHEA viewpoint.

h3. Available Diagrams

h4. Task View

The current version of the Task View shows the Task as a container with the included Runnables.

Open/Create a view for a __Task__ element by right click on it and select __Task View__.

!../pictures/sirius_task_view_create.png!

A new diagram is shown based on the given __Task__ element.

h5. Communication Layer

The Communication Layer shows direct dependencies between __Runnables__. Therefore the following requirement must be fulfilled:

# Runnable R1 writes Label L1
# Runnable R2 reads Label L1

Enable it through the Layers option menu.

In this sample some of the available communications are fulfilling this requirement.

h5. Label Layer

The Label Layer shows all Read/Write dependencies between __Runnables__ and __Labels__.

Enable it through the Layers option menu.

!../pictures/sirius_task_view_label_layer_enable.png!

After some arrangement it can look like the following:

h4. Label View

The Label View shows a __Label__ element including read/write accesses from corresponding __Runnables__.

Open/Create a view for a __Label__ element by right click on it and select __Label View__.

!../pictures/sirius_label_view_create.png!

A new diagram is shown based on the given __Label__ element.

h4. EventChain View

The __EventChain__ view is the first version to show the included __Events__.
If there is a reference to a __RunnableEvent__, the corresponding __Runnable__ is also shown.
This behavior can be extended also for __Labels__ and __Tasks__ for example.

Open/Create a view for an __EventChain__ element by right click on it and select __Event Chain View__.

!../pictures/sirius_event_chain_view_create.png!

A new diagram is opening showing the order of the included __Events__.
If there is a __RunnableEvent__, the association to the __Runnable__ includes the configured __EventType__.

h4. Tasks View

The __Tasks__ view is in general the same view as the already mentioned __Task__ view above with the advantage to get an overview about all included __Tasks__ of a Software model.

To open/create a Tasks view it is needed to switch to the Sirius perspective.
* This can be done by **Window - Perspective - Open Perspective - Other** and select then Sirius.
* On the left side inside of the Model Explorer go to an AMALTHEA model, expand it and do a right click on the __Software__ model.
* Select **New Representation - new Tasks Overview** to create a new diagram.
* Change the name if needed and click on ok.

The same additional options are available as in the normal __Task__ view like the __Label Layer__ and __Communication Layer__.

h4. Mapping View

The __Mapping__ view gives an overview of the relation between __Cores__, __Schedulers__ and __Tasks__, which is defined in the __Mapping Model__ of AMALTHEA.

To open/create a Tasks view it is needed to switch to the Sirius perspective.
* This can be done by **Window - Perspective - Open Perspective - Other** and select then Sirius.
* On the left side inside of the Model Explorer go to an AMALTHEA model, expand it and do a right click on the __Mapping__ model.
* Select **New Representation - new Tasks Overview** to create a new diagram.
* Change the name if needed and click on ok.
