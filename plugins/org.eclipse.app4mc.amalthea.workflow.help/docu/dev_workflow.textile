h1. Model Workflow

h2. Introduction

The APP4MC AMALTHEA platform provides the option to define a workflow on a model with different steps. AMALTHEA provides a simple API for implementing such a workflow. The definition of the workflow can be done either in plain Java or any other language, which is able to access Java classes. The "EASE":https://www.eclipse.org/ease/ framework provides a scripting environment inside of Eclipse with different script engines like  Rhino (JavaScript), Jython or Groovy. AMALTHEA provides a sample and some convenient helpers based on EASE to define and execute such a workflow.
AMALTHEA provides several plugins for this purpose: 

* __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core__: Includes basic API and some predefined workflow components
* __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.ease__: Provides some helper modules for EASE

h2. General Structure

The plugin __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core__ provides a general abstract class @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.WorkflowComponent@ which can be used to extend in the case to provide or implement an own workflow step.

!../pictures/uml_workflow_component.png!

It provides the following features:

* Defines the constant @AMALTHEA_SLOT@, which can be used to store and retrieve the AMALTHEA model from the @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.Context@.
* Provides some convenient methods to retrieve the model from the context, get a copy of the model or store the model in the context.

The interface @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.Context@ provides convenient methods to store and retrieve data in a @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.WorkflowComponent@.

!../pictures/uml_context.png!

The class @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.DefaultContext@ is a default implementation using an internal @java.util.HashMap@ to store the data.

!../pictures/uml_default_context.png!

A sample workflow implementation with two components @WorkfklowComponent1@ and @WorkflowComponent2@ can look like the following structure.

Both classes are extending @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.WorkflowComponent@.

!../pictures/uml_workflow_overview.png!

The next step is to create a __WorkflowDefinition__, which needs to do the following steps:

# Create an instance of a @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.Context@ using the @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.DefaultContext@
# Create an instance of @WorkfklowComponent1@ and configure it if needed with the proper setter methods
# Call the __run__ method of @WorkfklowComponent1@ and pass the context
# Create an instance of @WorkfklowComponent2@ and configure it if needed with the proper setter methods
# Call the __run__ method of @WorkfklowComponent2@ and pass the context

Therefore using the context, data can be shared between the different workflow component implementations.
The following diagram shows this flow in more detail:

!../pictures/uml_workflow_overview_sequence.png!

h2(#AC). Available Basic Components

The AMALTHEA platform ships with some available workflow steps, which can be used out of the box.

h3. Model Reader

The component @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.component.ModelReader@ reads a given list of files containing AMALTHEA models. The result model is stored in the @AMALTHEA_SLOT@ as default. Please refer the JavaDoc for more details.

!../pictures/uml_model_reader.png!

Simple configuration inside of a workflow can look like the following:

bc.. 
ModelReader reader = new ModelReader();
reader.addFileName("path to file");
reader.run(ctx);

h3. Model Writer

The component @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.component.ModelWriter@ writes a given AMALTHEA model to either one file or several files. As default the current available model in the @AMALTHEA_SLOT@ is taken.
The following parameters are available to set:
* @boolean singleFile@ default @true@
* @String@ @outputDir@
* @String@ @fileName@, if output is set to split files the different models are separated by an additional suffix in the name indicating the contained model.

!../pictures/uml_model_writer.png!

Sample configuration inside of a workflow:

bc.. 
ModelWriter writer = new ModelWriter();
writer.setOutputDir("path to dir");
writer.setFileName("output.amxmi");
writer.run(ctx);

h3. Add Schedule Points

The component @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.component.AddSchedulePoints@ modifies a given model (default in the @AMALTHEA_SLOT@) in that way, that in the @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.sw.SWModel@ the contained @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.sw.Task@ elements are checked if the preemption is set to cooperative. If this is the case, it will add between the elements of the @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.sw.CallGraph@ new elements of type @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.model.sw.SchedulePoint@.

!../pictures/uml_add_schedule_points.png!

Sample configuration inside of a workflow:

bc.. 
AddSchedulePoints addSchedulePoints = new AddSchedulePoints();
addSchedulePoints.run(ctx);

h2. Other Components

h3. Create Tasks

The component @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.workflow.CreateTasks@ from the plugin __org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping__ is the corresponding workflow element for the "Task creation example":./examples.html#tce. It takes a copy of a given model (defaults to @AMALTHEA_SLOT@) and performs the action @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.algorithms.taskgen.pragmatic.PragmaticTaskCreator@. The result of this action is stored as default in the model slot __createtasks__.

!../pictures/uml_create_tasks.png!

Sample configuration inside of a workflow:

bc.. 
CreateTasks ct = new CreateTasks();
ct.run(ctx);

h3. Generate Mapping

The component @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.workflow.GenerateMapping@ from the plugin __org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping__ is the corresponding workflow element for the "Mapping example":./examples.html#me. It takes a copy of a given model (defaults to @AMALTHEA_SLOT@) and performs one of the actions @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.algorithms.heuristic.lb.LoadBalancingDFG@ or @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.algorithms.ilp.lb.ILPBasedLoadBalancing@ or @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.algorithms.ilp.energyminimization.EnergyMinimization@ or @org.eclipse.app4mc.multicore.openmapping.algorithms.ga.lb.GABasedLoadBalancing@ depending on the parameter @mappingAlg@. The result of this action is stored as default in the model slot __mapping__.
Parameter:

* @String@ @mappingAlg@ with the value of either __dfg__ or __ilp_lb__ or __ilp_energy__ or __ga_lb__

Sample configuration inside of a workflow:

bc.. 
GenerateMapping mappingDfg = new GenerateMapping();
mappingDfg.setModelSlot("createtasks");
mappingDfg.setMappingAlg("dfg");
mappingDfg.setEnableLog(true);
mappingDfg.run(ctx);

h2. EASE modules

The purpose of using EASE is to provide one way to define and run a workflow for a model.
Therefore APP4MC provides some helper methods to be used in the "EASE":https://www.eclipse.org/ease/ scripting environment. 
The modules are provided by the plugin __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.ease__.

h3. Workflow Module

The workflow module provides some helpers regarding running a APP4MC workflow definition based on EASE.
The general module can be loaded with the following line:

bc. 
loadModule('/APP4MC/Workflow')

EASE opens an own Eclipse console by default to show the output of the executed script when using right click and __Run as -> EASE Script__. Therefore if you are using Log4J for your logging, you can use the following provided methods to configure dedicated Log4J Loggers to use also the EASE console for output.

The following overview gives an overview about the available helper methods:

|_. Method |_. Params |_. Description |
| addLoggerToConsole | String loggerName | Adds a Log4J logger to the output of the current used output of the EASE script engine. |
| addLoggerToConsole | String loggerName, String pattern | Adds a Log4J logger to the output of the current used output of the EASE script engine with a given pattern, see @org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout@ for more details |
| endWorkflow | - | Basic finish actions to be performed, should be called at the end |


h2. Overall Sample

A sample workflow is available in the AMALTHEA example projects inside of @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.example.democar.mapping/workflow/sample_workflow.js@. In general this workflow contains all steps as shown in the AMALTHEA examples tutorial "Task creation":./examples.html#tce and "Mapping example":./examples.html#me, but it can be executed in one script. Execute it by doing a right click and then __Run As -> EASE Script__.
The following steps are performed in the sample configuration:

# Read the files __AMALTHEA_Democar_MappingExample.amxmi__ and __AMALTHEA_Democar_MappingExample-hw.amxmi__ inside if the model folder. Result model is saved in the default @AMALTHEA_SLOT@.
# Perform the "Create Tasks":#CreateTasks component
# Write the result model available in the __createtasks__ model slot to a single model file __createtasks__ in the directory __workflow-output__.
# Perform the "Generate Mapping":#GenerateMapping component with the dfg algorithm on the result of the Create Tasks component. This is done by specifying @modelSlot = "createtasks"@.
# Write the result model available in the __mapping__ model slot to a single model file __mapping_dfg__ in the directory __workflow-output__.
# Perform the "Generate Mapping":#GenerateMapping component with the ilp algorithm on the result of the Create Tasks component. This is done by specifying @modelSlot = "createtasks"@. In addition the result slot is overwritten by @resultSlot = "mappingilp"@, as the previous run of Generate Mapping is already stored in the mapping slot.
# Write the result model available in the __mapping_ilp__ model slot to a single model file __mapping_ilp__ in the directory __workflow-output__.

The following diagram shows a snippet of this workflow:

!../pictures/sample_workflow.png!

h2. Adding a new workflow component

Below you will find a sample how to add and implement a new workflow component.

h3. Create project

# Add a new plugin project with the name __my.sample.workflow__
# Open the __MANIFEST.MF__ in the META-INF folder.
# Switch to the tab Dependencies to add the following plugin dependencies: org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core
# Add a new class @my.sample.workflow.HelloWorld@, which is extending @org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.workflow.core.WorkflowComponent@.
# Implement something in the @runInternal(Context ctx) throws WorkflowException@ method (see sample below).

bc.. 
@Override
protected void runInternal(Context ctx) throws WorkflowException {
	// some checking if sw model is available
	if (null == getAmaltheaModel(ctx).getSwModel()) {
		throw new WorkflowException("No proper SWModel available!");
	}
	this.log.info("Number of tasks in model: " + getAmaltheaModel(ctx).getSwModel().getTasks().size());
}

h3. Execute the new component in the available sample

The previous created class @my.sample.workflow.HelloWorld@ should be added to a workflow.
Therefore we are using the provided sample project from APP4MC __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.example.democar.mapping__.
Before starting with the next steps, we need to start a new runtime from the existing workspace, so that the plugin __my.sample.workflow__ is already loaded.

*Note:* If you want to use the classes from the plugin __my.sample.workflow__ in a EASE script located in the same workspace, you can create an instance of it at runtime using the JVM module of EASE. Please consider the EASE documentation for more details.

# Add the AMALTHEA democar samples to your workspace (File - New - Example - Democar Examples)
# Go to the project __org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.example.democar.mapping__.
# Open the __sample_workflow.js__ located in the workflow folder.
# Add to the imports: @importPackage(my.sample.workflow)@
# Add to the logger configs: @addLoggerToConsole("my.sample.workflow")@
# Add the First snippet below after the first AmaltheaReader component and before the CreateTasks component.
# Run the script by doing a right click -> Run As -> EASE Script

bc.. 
var ctx = new DefaultContext()

//Reader
var reader = new ModelReader()
reader.addFileName(MODEL_LOCATION1)
reader.addFileName(MODEL_LOCATION2)
reader.run(ctx)

var hw = new HelloWorld()
hw.run(ctx)

//create tasks based on initial model
//result is saved in modelslot createtasks
var createTasks = new CreateTasks()
createTasks.run(ctx)
