h3. Steps to create a new AMALTHEA model

APP4MC provides a standard wizard to create a new AMALTHEA model from scratch.

p. *Step 1: Create a new general project*

bq..  The scope of an AMALTHEA model is defined by its enclosing container (project or folder).
      Therefore a project is required.

p. *Step 2: Create a new folder inside of the created project*

bq..  It is recommended to create a folder ( __although a project is also a possible container__ ).

p. *Step 3: Create a new AMALTHEA model*

bq..  In the context menu (right mouse button) an entry for a new AMALTHEA model can be found.

      Another starting point is __File__ -> __New__ -> __Other__

      In the dialog you can select the parent folder and the file name.


h3. AMALTHEA Editor

The AMALTHEA Editor shows either the entire model that contains sub models or one of the sub models.
The next screenshot shows the "New Child" menu with all its possibilities.

In addition the AMALTHEA Editor has two commands available at the top right of the Editor.

h4. Show types of model elements

The Show types of elements button triggers the editor to show the direct type of the element in the tree editor using [element_type]. The following screenshot shows the toggle and the types marked with an underline.

h4. Search for model elements

The editor provides the possibility to filter model elements by using the available name attribute. This can be used for example to filter all elements in the model which has abs in their name. The search and result view is using the Eclipse search as result view.

The search result is using the Eclipse Search View.

An additional option is to toggle the search results to group them by type as shown in the next screenshot.
