The following section will describe how to generate tasks out of software models with __sequencing constraints__.

*Step 1*

Create a new example project based on the "Democar Example" (*File -> New -> Example*).

*Step 2*

!(gray)../pictures/ExampleMapping/04-generate-tasks.png!

Click on the left arrow of the "org.eclipse.app4mc.amalthea.example.democar.mapping" project to expand it. You will see several files with models of the democar project, each of them containing one specific model, e.g. "AMALTHEA_Democar_MappingExample.amxmi" with the software model and constraints model. Usually, a software model needs to be partitioned before it can be mapped. You can either use the partitioning plugin for this, or the included (already partitioned) software model.
Right-click on the file "AMALTHEA_Democar_MappingExample.amxmi" and click "Generate Tasks" to start the task generation process. This will also convert the __Activation__ elements from the partitioned software model to __Stimuli__ and store these in a stimulation model.

*Step 3*

Once the tasks have been generated, a new file with tasks will be created in the "output" folder. The file "AMALTHEA_Democar_MappingExample_withTasks.amxmi" contains the final software model, the stimulation model and the constraints model and is ready to be mapped.
