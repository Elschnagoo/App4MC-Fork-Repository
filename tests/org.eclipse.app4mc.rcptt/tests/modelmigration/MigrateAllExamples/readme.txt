MigrateAllExamples_test file contains RCPTT script to invoke model migration for all the examples.
 -- This script will be very helpful when migrating all the examples at one go (if there are major changes in meta model) 
    ** Motivation to write this TC: Avoid repeated clicks on various model files to invoke model migration :-)  
    
 In order to use this TC, modify the file name to have "test" as extension
